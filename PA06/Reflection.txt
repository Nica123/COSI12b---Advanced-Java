My app is a drawing board which you draw using pen choosing different colors and even customized you own colors. Also you can insert shapes including circles, squares, rectangles and so on.
1.
I Integrated GUI and graphic panel together in one JFrame using Boarder layout.
I set the LINE_START part to be control panel which uses cardLayout and gridLayout to make the menu.
-Buttons functioned to control the colors and shapes.
-Textfield in customized color window is set to customize oneâ€™s own color.
-I used two new widgets Jcolorchooser and card layout.

2.I is interacted with mouse as you can draw anything and insert a shape of any color anywhere.

3.It has inner classes including point line and shape
Arraylist consists of point and line and shape

The best thing about the app it is very convenient to change the color of drawing.

Although this app is functional as a basic sketchpad, it can be improved by adding more customized elements like a oval that changes its shape when dragging its edge.
